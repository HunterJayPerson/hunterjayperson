    <div class="profile-content">
        <p>I am an engineer and entrepreneur trying to make sure AI is developed without killing everybody. I’ve mainly worked as a CEO and software &amp; robotics engineer, but have also had various gigs as a fast food cook, actor, STEM tutor, children’s entertainer, video editor, and drag queen. <br><br>I was born in 1996 and grew up in western Sydney, Australia. My Dad was a plasterer, and my Mum an accountant. I am atheist, vegan, disappointingly AMAB, tall and lanky, and have ‘traces of Aspergers’ according to my childhood school. Politically I lean libertarian, but no label really fits. My favourite media includes Feynman’s autobiographies, HPMOR, Legally Blonde the Musical, and synthwave music. <br><br>In 2016, I was studying Physics &amp; Mathematics at USyd when I realised that superintelligence would become the most important thing for humanity to get right in my lifetime. I switched my major to Computer Science, and began working on generating resources and knowledge that could be useful for aligning superintelligence, on the margin. I’ve been doing that ever since.<br><br>Please feel free to contact me at hunter@hunterjay.com</p>
